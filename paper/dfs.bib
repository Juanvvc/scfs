Originally designed to work for tracking and processing mortgages through origination and secondary marketing at HomeSide Lending Incorporated in Jacksonville, Florida, it can be generalized to handle any business process that involves well-defined states and a series of transitions between them. Included besides the modules to handle the processing of business rules, are modules for database and socket communications, exception handling, and logging facilities",

Since none of any forwarding algorithms is perfect. Most existed search techniques exhibit varying performances when applying homogeneous forwarding logic in each peer. This paper proposes a promising approach to improve search through heterogeneous forwarding algorithms mixing, named cocktail search (CS) technique. Its core principle is that available forwarding algorithms are selected probabilistically in each peer to avoid the drawback of single algorithm. In this paper, the basic principle of CS technique is presented and game theory is employed to verify its feasibility. The simulation results demonstrate that this technique shows significant advantages over others",

The paradigm problem con- sidered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash- coding methods are examined and compared with a par- ticular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to ``catch'' the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that al- lowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.",

We propose a MLTG (Multilayer Topic-Group) based P2P Network. Two core concepts are integrated into the system structure: topic-group and hierarchic layer. Peers act as Local Peers, Delegate Peers and Super-Peers. These peers spread on different hierarchic layers and the system distributes the correlative resources among the same groups. Compared with the traditional P2P schemes, the MLTG is out-performed significantly. From the experiments, it saves up to 90% of query cost for the case of a single keyword query. When the query consists of topic and keywords, it saves up to 93% of cost. MLTG guarantees the enhancement of successful search and lower consumption of bandwidth. It also makes the system more available, reliable and efficient. \&copy; 2006 IEEE.",

P2P computing is a potentially powerful model for information sharing between ad-hoc groups of users because of its low cost of entry and natural model for resource scaling. As P2P communities grow, however, locating information distributed across the large number of peers becomes problematic. We address this problem by adapting a state-of-the-art text-based document ranking algorithm, the vector-space model instantiated with the TFxIDF ranking rule, to the P2P environment. We make three contributions: (a) we show how to approximate TFxIDF using compact summaries of individual peers' inverted indexes rather than the inverted index of the entire communal store; (b) we develop a heuristic for adaptively determining the set of peers that should be contacted for a query; and (c) we show that our algorithm tracks TFxIDF's performance very closely, giving P2P communities a search and retrieval algorithm as good as that possible assuming a centralized server",

The main idea of the proposed mechanism is to classify the attributes of computing resources into two groups: a static attribute group and a dynamic attribute group. The attributes classified into the static attribute group are managed in a centralized manner, while the attributes in the dynamic attribute group are managed in a decentralized manner. In resource searching, this hybrid-type resource management mechanism can limit the candidates based on the static attributes firsts, and then the appropriate resources can be searched according to the dynamic attributes only within the area restricted by the static attributes. Therefore, the mechanism can prevent the network traffic explosion due to the flooding search in native P2P systems. Performance evaluation is carried out theoretically and experimentally. The results of theoretical evaluation indicate that the proposed model is well-suited for the resource search required by the ubiquitous computing, compared with both a typical server-client model and a P2P-based model. Prototyping the proposed mechanism experimentally shows its feasibility",

TAPER is designed to be bandwidth efficient, scalable and content-based, and it does not require prior knowledge of the replica state. To achieve these properties, TAPER provides: i) four pluggable redundancy elimination phases that balance the trade-off between bandwidth savings and computation overheads, ii) a hierarchical hash tree based directory pruning phase that quickly matches identical data from the granularity of directory trees to individual files, iii) a content-based similarity detection technique using Bloom filters to identify similar files, and iv) a combination of coarse-grained chunk matching with finer-grained block matches to achieve bandwidth efficiency. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we observe that in comparison with rsync, a widely-used directory synchronization tool, TAPER reduces bandwidth by 15% to 71%, performs faster matching, and scales to a larger number of replicas",

However, there are four main differences between the developed method and the SPICE-type simulators: (i) preservation of the circuit hierarchy during the analysis, (ii) different analysis methods for different sub-circuits (multi-mode analysis), (iii) an open structure allowing the easy addition of new simulation techniques, and (iv) substantially higher speed. The new algorithm is particularly suitable for large circuits, such as multi-function MMICs, since a circuit is decomposed into smaller sub-circuits which are simulated individually and parallelly. Each sub-circuit can be solved using the most appropriate technique for that sub-circuit, leading to improved efficiency and/or accuracy.

Semantic routing is a method of pruning a flooding search such that queries are preferentially forwarded to nodes that can answer those queries. Previous simulations (Joseph, 2002) showed that under certain circumstances semantic routing leads to a reduction in search path length.

In addition, we advocate building a hierarchical organization of nodes by clustering together nodes with similar content. Similarity between nodes is related to the similarity between the corresponding filters. We also present an efficient method for update propagation.

They include that (1) a limited number of hosts being searched leads to a limited number of hits; (2) the search result is not accurate due to the search by filename; and (3) an inefficient use of computer resource - spending too much resource on handling other peers' queries. In order to rectify these drawbacks, this paper proposes n-phase search and passive search mechanisms. Compared with the traditional search mechanism, n-phase search increases the number of received query hits by 55.41% and increases the host coverage by 41.23%. For the passive search, the average search time is reduced by 15.33%",

Peer-to-peer computing relies on individual computers' computing power and storage capacity to better utilize bandwidth and distribute this load in a self-organizing manner. In P2P, nodes (or peers) act as both clients and servers, form an application-level network, and route messages (such as requests to locate a resource). The design of these routing protocols is of paramount importance to a P2P application's efficiency: naive approaches - such as Gnutella's flood routing, for example - can add traffic. P2P systems that exhibit the ``small world'' property - in which most peers have few links to other peers, but a few of them have many - are robust to random attacks, but can be highly vulnerable to targeted ones. P2P computing also has the potential to enhance reliability and fault tolerance because it doesn't rely on dedicated servers.' Each peer maintains a local directory with entries to the resources it manages. It can also cache other peers' directory entries. Important applications of P2P technologies include distributed directory systems, new e-commerce models, and Web service discovery, all of which require efficient resource-location mechanisms",

Although IP traceback techniques have been proposed in the literature, these techniques cannot help when we do not have the entire packet or when we only have an excerpt of the payload. In this paper, we present a payload attribution system (PAS) that attributes reasonably long excerpts of payloads to their source and/or destination hosts. The system we propose is based on a novel data structure called a Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF). An HBF creates compact digests of payloads and provides probabilistic answers to membership queries on the excerpts of payloads. We also present the performance analysis of the method and experimental results from a prototype demonstrating the practicality and efficacy of the system. The system can reliably work with certain packet transformations and is flexible enough to be used if the query string is spread across several packets. The system, however, can be evaded by splitting or by ``stuffing'' the payload. Future work focuses on making the system robust against such evasions. Copyright 2004 ACM.",

Thus, the users suffer from long search latency when performing hybrid search due to inaccurate estimations of the resource popularity. In this paper, we propose a popularity biased hybrid search method in systems. Our model allows the P2P systems dynamically detect the content popularity, and accurately make a decision of search methods.

This paper proposes a new scheme for resource routing, called hybrid hierarchical overlay routing, dubbed Hyho. We introduce distance-weighted Bloom filters (dwBFs) as a concise representation of routing information for scattered resources in overlay networks. To further reduce the size of Bloom filters, so that they are linear in the number of distinct resources, Hyho splits overlay networks in accordance with DHT, where each subnetwork has a smaller set of resources and spans the entire network thinly. As a result, Hyho constructs a hierarchical overlay network and routes requests accordingly. Simulation results show that Hyho can reduce overlay dilation to one half that yielded by the Chord lookup service.",

These systems are attractive because they deliver on the Internet's promise of true decentralization, offering scalability, availability, fault tolerance, robustness, and low barriers to entry. While P2P systems have been used so far mainly for file sharing, their true potential lies as a vast, loosely connected world wide infrastructure for sharing resources, data and information. However, many challenging research problems must be addressed and solved before this vision can materialize. This paper addresses a natural step in the evolution of P2P: going beyond simple file sharing based on exact-name based lookups to data and information sharing where data is accessed based on its attributes or properties. We have identified diverse applications such as network monitoring, astronomy data applications, event-notification systems, and Grid computing that can benefit directly from attribute-based access to distributed data over P2P systems. Based on the application requirements, we propose three new models for both data distribution and data accesses. For each of these models, we propose CAN and CHORD like structures for data storage and information retrieval. A novel aspect of our development is that one of the models identified is directly applicable for building content-based publish/subscribe systems over P2P networks. \&copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",

The main idea advocated in this paper is that simple cryptographic techniques are sufficient to engineer an efficient data encoding that can make it significantly harder to selectively censor information. Our encoding allows users to share files encrypted under descriptive keys which are the basis for querying the network for content. A key property of our encoding is that intermediaries can filter invalid encrypted replies without being able to decrypt the query or the reply.

This paradigm has become possible with the advent of broadband wireless networking technologies such as IEEE 802.11. One of the most popular applications in these networks is peer-to-peer (P2P) file exchange. Node cooperation can optimize the usage of shared ``external'' accesses to the Internet (set of links between the user network and the Internet). In a previous paper, we evaluated different agent-oriented distributed control schema, based on the concept of credit limits, on ideal mesh networks subject to uniform traffic. Each node in the mesh network chooses to behave as a cooperator or a defector. Cooperators may assist in file exchange, whereas defectors try to get advantage of network resources without providing help in return. Before this paper was completed, we observed that popular P2P protocols like eMule, Kazaa and BitTorrent were evolving towards the same credit-oriented strategies we previously proposed. Now, we realistically model both user network traffic and topology, and evaluate a new advanced agent-based distributed control scheme. The simulation results in this paper confirm on realistic networks the main conclusion in our previous research: autonomous node agents become cooperators in their permanent state when they take decisions from local information, checking that file exchange services offered to neighbor nodes do not exceed appropriate credit limits. \&copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",

Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and difficult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.",

In this paper, we study BitTorrent, a new and already very popular peer-to-peer application that allows distribution of very large contents to a large set of hosts. Our analysis of BitTorrent is based on measurements collected on a five months long period that involved thousands of peers. We assess the performance of the algorithms used in BitTorrent through several metrics.

To save network bandwidth and avoid a point of failure of a directory server, structured P2P systems using DHT (Distributed Hashing Table) like Chord are more suitable for MANET. However, since MANET allows nodes to depart from network, P2P file sharing applications based on Chord lookup protocol should address how to recovery the keys stored at the departed node. In this paper, we propose BU-Chord (Back-Up Chord) in order to detect and recover the departure of nodes by creating and storing a back-up file information in distributed manner. Simulation study proves that our BU-Chord shows off better performance than the existing Chord especially at high departure rate of nodes. \&copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",

P2P networks can be classified into unstructured and structured. Unstructured P2P networks use flooding mechanism or a central index server to search resources on the network. While structured P2P networks use a distributed hash table (DHT) to locate resources. An unstructured P2P network is simpler but has high searching cost. But structured P2P networks may not be suitable for a highly dynamic environment. This paper presents a new P2P model, an index-based structured P2P network named IS-P2P. IS-P2P networks leverage the heterogeneity of peers and use hybrid two-layer architecture. The upper layer consists of indexing peers that form a structured P2P network, and it provides publishing and searching services for the other peers. The lower layer consists of common peers that can join and leave the P2P network freely. Performance analysis shows that IS-P2P can be applied to a highly dynamic environment with good searching performance. In addition, routing performance, searching speed, size of the indexing database and cost of transmitting query are also improved as well",

In general, query results contain many references to the same data object. These references are grouped, and the size of the group-the number of references it contains-is the typical ranking metric. Although group size is effective in finding popular data, it works poorly for rare, less popular data. Other ranking functions, such as precision and cosine similarity, are more appropriate in this case. We show the significant performance benefit in finding rare data using these ranking functions through extensive simulation. \&copy; 2005 IEEE.",

	abstract = "In this paper we consider large distributed systems in which objects are shared among several users. Our focus is on Peer-To-Peer (P2P) systems and, specifically, we present an adaptive algorithm for file fragments allocation on multiple servers belonging to a P2P network, derived from the Adaptive Data Replication (ADR) algorithm by Wolfson and Jajodia. While the ADR algorithm handles replicas of files, our algorithm handles (replicated) fragments of files. Moreover, while the ADR algorithm does not take into account any security issue, we also make some critical considerations about security of the system and show how a replicated-fragmentation scheme is convenient for sharing information in P2P networks, for achieving both high performance and security. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in terms of transmission cost of packets, i.e. in terms of network utilization of the system, in contrast of the number of packets exchanged by peers, and the transmission cost is analyzed theoretically. \&copy; 2005 IEEE.",
